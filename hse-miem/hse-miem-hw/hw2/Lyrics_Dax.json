(Why?)\nWhat's the point of love?\nEvery time I've showed it I was broken and it's forced me just to only wanna hate\nWhy's there only one you but multiple religions? (Why?)\nWhy does every conversation end in a division? (Why?)\nWhy does everybody want to tell us how to live\nBut they won't listen to the same damn message that they givin'? (Fuck them)\nTell me how to feel, tell me what's wrong\nI tried to call, pick up the phone (Pick up)\nI'm on my own\nEverybody said you comin' back, then man why the hell's it takin' so long?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy do I hurt? (Why?) Why is there pain?\nWhy does everything good always have to change? (Why)\nWhy does everybody try to profit off another man's work\nThen destroy it just for monetary gain?\nTell me are you black or are you white?\nI don't even really care I just really want to know what's right (I don't care)\nThey been sayin' one thing but I've been lookin' in the book\nAnd it seems like they've been lyin' for my whole damn life\nTell me where I'm goin' (Where?) Is it heaven or hell?\nI just hope this message greets you well\nHad a dream that I was walkin' with the devil, don't remember how it feels\nBut I swear that I remember the smell\nLooked me right into my eye and told me everything I wanted could be mine\nIf I gave up and decided to sell\nBut I said I'd rather die then get mine, now I'm here\nNo fear, one man with a story to tell\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nDear God, where were you when I needed it? When I fucked up and repeated it?\nWhen they set the bar and I exceeded it? (Where were you?)\nMy life is like a book that they've been judgin' by a cover\nBut have never took the time to fuckin' read the shit (Fuck)\nI remember tellin' you my goals and my dreams\nBut you didn't even answer, so I guess you didn't believe in it\nI remember sittin' with a gun to my head tryna ask you for some help\nBut I guess you didn't believe in it\nI don't want religion, I need that spirituality\nI don't want a church, I need people to call a family\nI don't wanna tell my sins to another sinner\nJust because he's got a robe and he went to some academy\nI don't wanna read it in a book, I wanna hear it from you\nDon't wanna learn it in my school because they hidin' the truth (Swear)\nDon't wanna talk about it to another fuckin' human being\nAnd that's only reason that I even stepped in this booth\n\n[Verse 4]\nDear God\nHow do I take this darkness and turn it into light? (Talk to me)\nHow do believe in a concept where I speak to a man\nI've never seen with my own two eyes? (How?)\nHow do I know that religion wasn't made\nJust to separate the world and create a whole disguise\nJust to keep us in these chains while the rich get richer\nAnd the poor pray to you and perpetuate a lie?\nHow do I know this ain't some big joke? (How?)\nHow can I have faith when there is no hope? (How?)\nHow the hell does one man have 100 billion dollars\nAnd we still have people on the street that are broke?\nThere's a lot of things I wanna talk about and get off my chest\nI can't sleep 'cause the devil won't let me rest\nI used to know a fuckin' pastor in a church\nAnd I can still hear the screams of the kids he would fuckin' molest\n[Verse 5]\nDear God\nDo you hear me? (Do you hear me?)\nI'm supposed to fear you but you ain't said shit\nSo maybe it's you who actually fears me?\nI don't know the answer, I just want to see it clearly\nSo many lies there's a 1000 different theories\nAll I want to know is who really made religion\n'Cause I know it wasn't you but don't nobody believe me\nNo more lies, no more death\nBring back King, bring back X\nPlease dear God let their souls rest\nProtect who's left and watch their steps\nDear God (Dear God)\nI don't want to have to ask you again\nI just hope that you know that I'm still a believer\nSo I'll end this all by sayin' amen\n(It's Dax)29Embed"

I gave my all to you\nThere\u2019s a kid that no ones knows about and me and you both know I am the father to\nThat means I am a part of you, you went and broke my heart in two\nThen stabbed me in the back and watched me bleed and pulled an audible\nFuck! How you think this gon' end?\nCause I been dealing with depression, social media attention\nThey expect me to be happy but I\u2019m fucking depressed\nI swear I\u2019m fucking depressed\nAll the money in the world don\u2019t mean a thing if you can\u2019t share it with somebody that you love and that you fucking respect (Dax)\nDo you know how it feels to be awake\nBut all you want to do is go back to sleep? (Do you?)\nBecause reality is suffocating pushing on your chest so all you want to do is go and live your life in your dreams? (Can you relate?)\nDo you know how it feels when the person that you love doesn\u2019t love you back?\nWhen they say the right things but their actions are the opposite of everything they tell you everyday to relax? (I need help)\nBitch I would've killed for you! (Yeah)\nMan fuck all of this music shit I\u2019d pass up on a deal for you! (Uh, yeah)\nOther niggas tried to fuck, I swear I only saw the real in you!\nYou cheated twice and now I can\u2019t deal with you!\nIt\u2019s Dax\nYou might also like[Prayer]\nDear God\nI ask that you give me the strength, to trust again\nPlease help me relieve this burden from my heart\nI know time heals all wounds and some just take longer than others\nSo I'm going to trust you with this process\nAmen\n\n[Outro]\nEverybody put your hands up if you can relate\nWe all been there, this is for you17Embed"

(Indeed). But I think you know that already\nYou call me evil but how would you know it unless you live it already? (Hahaha)\nYou think you\u2019re better right?\n'Cause nobody's seen what you've done in the dark but if I put your life in this light\nYou would crumble and fight to survive or die but, bitch, I fucking knew that already\nI ain't special\nBut I specialize in making you feel especially stupid for judging a human\nWhile you sit at home and the whole world can't watch what you're doing or follow and hate all your movements\nI ain't complaining but I know the people who do it are sicker than me and I'm sick enough I just might lose it\nYa, you think you know me 'cause you double-tap on a picture\nI hate the fact that you judge me it\u2019s driving me crazy so when it\u2019s too deep I say fuck it and drown in some liquor\nI write these verses in blood I got chapters for days 'cause my heart is a biblical scripture\nAnd I ain't a prophet but I can predict that you\u2019ll never catch happiness till you're the pitcher\nSo please continue to laugh, if I'm a clown you're a circus act\nWhen I rap it\u2019s in a surgeon's mask\n'Cause I place every syllable in a deliverable fashion from first to last\nThen cut back with a message that\u2019s hidden in melody making them think and ask\nIf I was the one on the table pushing, giving birth to rap\nMaybe it was me, maybe you like all my music but don\u2019t really actually love me\nMaybe you just want a picture, maybe you just want to see me 'cause you need some money\nMaybe you think that I'm happy\nMaybe you think in reality liking my post is repairing a hole when it\u2019s actually shaking and cutting the soul right out of me\nI think I'm sick\nI feel a rush of emotion whenever I post up a pic\nI got a problem, I'm in the studio rapping while this girl is sucking my dick\nShe cut a hole in my heart now I fill it with women who love me 'cause they think I'm rich\nAnd if I be honest I just told a bitch that I care but I really do not give a shit\nSo what\u2019s your excuse? What helps you sleep?\nYou leave a negative comment not knowing what you soul you will reap\nI bet you smile when you post, thinking you're hurting me, but you see\nThe way the brain works you become what you speak\nI need peace! But y\u2019all can\u2019t offer that (you can't!)\nI held my ground, I didn\u2019t sell my soul, I said fuck the fame, y\u2019all can take that offer back\nFuck a shelf you can't take me off the rack\nAll the fame is not worth the heart attack\nYou're insane, you're in pain, I can tell by what you're saying, but\nMy bad, I forgot you were fragile\nI forgot someone who doesn't even know me told you I'm an asshole\nI forgot that I'm the villain\nI forgot that I've always spread positivity, but you think I didn't\nI forgot that hatred stems from people who hate their own existence\nI forgot I'm better off alone\nI forgot I care for everyone's happiness, but forget about my own\nI forgot I spend every waken second on my phone, (hahahaha)\nCome and join my circus, I\u2019m recruiting\nI\u2019m taking everyone who passes judgement, bitch, that\u2019s including\nEveryone who thinks it\u2019s so amusing\nTo put me down while I\u2019m pursuing\nThe keyboard warriors that live online behind a screen that's just an illusion\nCome, come, come, come join my circus, you fucking pricks\nI\u2019ll fuck you till you love me then pay you to do some tricks\nI don't need a doctor, I need a bag of nails and bricks to lay down on the floor\nSo if you fail to land a flip you can feel what I felt when you tried to come sink my ship\nLet me explain, you all help me financially gain\nBut I spend my money on mental health books and read them just to control all my pain\nI don\u2019t wear clothes, but bought this chain and just like you this chain is fake\nI wear it to distract you from the blatant sadness written on my fucking face\nWhat'd you expect?\nDid you think I was immune to what you were saying and didn\u2019t see all of the disrespect?\nDo you think I'm not human, have no feelings, or maybe you think I\u2019m fucking weak and now I\u2019m pleading\nMaybe you think I\u2019m just too good and that I\u2019m fucking cheating?\nOr maybe, just maybe you're blind\nAnd the hate inside your heart clouds your eyes and your mind and your ears when I rhyme\nEven though we all know I\u2019m one of the best of all time\nOr maybe you're just a fucking bitch and I can't-\nStop comparing me to people who are not in my league\nStop saying I don\u2019t believe in God just because you can't read\nStop making fake profiles so you can spam my feed\nI'm not alone, I know there's millions out there just like meYou might also like8Embed"

I was told you\u2019ll find the most talent in the graveyard. Too many of us leave gifts inside and don\u2019t expose them to the world. That\u2019s what this song is all about. I\u2019m saying goodbye to the old me and so will you.\n\nDax additionally wrote this song to question those who listened to the song, and those his piece of work reached, with the question: \u201cAre you living to die, or dying to live?\u201d\n\nMuch of the song\u2019s material looks at Dax\u2019s past, his prior relationships, and regrets, with a small shoutout to his songs \u201cShe Cheated\u201d and \u201cShe Cheated Again\u201d, which were milestones for his career. It is essentially a rundown of Dax\u2019s entire personal life and feelings in two minutes and conceptually serves as his \u201clast words\u201d in a fictional scenario where he is about to die."

Because I need to make it to heaven\nBorn as a sinner, die as a winner\nPeriod just like the end of a sentence\nI swear the devil is watching me\nHe tried to make me his prodigy\nThis is my fucking apology\nI don't want nothin' but honesty\nHeaven to hell was just callin' me\n30 seconds left\nThese are my last words\nAnd to the bitch that broke my heart\nI just hope that you can sleep\nKnowing every single man you'll meet will never be like me\nYou can run, you can hide\nBut you will see me in your dreams\nOn TV\nIt's Dax!\n\n[Chorus]\nWish I can go back in time to my father, I didn't really mean it\nWish I can go tell my mom that I loved her, and all of this money I got I don't need it\nWish I could go to the church and I talked to the Lord in an effort to conquer my demons\nI'm beggin' and pleadin', I'm down on my knees and he's ready to shoot and I'm practically bleedin'\nSo this is my destiny, I finna get death to the G\nSomebody please help me, yeah\nThese are my last words\nIt's Dax!18Embed"

I'm an artist\nI just rap for fun but still do it the hardest\nHow I started was a baby given birth to by the Carters\n2Pac, Biggie, Nas, Rakim my grandfathers\nBeen rappin' for two years and probably done been the farthest\nHad to spark it made a name by manipulatin\u2019 the market\nHow'd I start it? Put it in drive and I never parked it\nThis a message to the dearly and departed\nThis a motherfuckin' killshot\nAimin' my scope at the fucking industry\nHalf of these niggas rappin' is trash and it's fucking killin' me\nI made a name for myself by doing it differently\nI started writing poetry then I had an epiphany\nAnd instantly started meshin' words into a symphony\nAnd calculatin\u2019 patterns and delivering them brilliantly\nTo go into your mind so I could paint a vivid imagery\nAnd save you from the trash that you\u2019ve been listenin' to literally\nNah, this is not a game, this is not a test\nWhat\u2019s the point of rappin' if I ain't tryna be the fuckin' best\nDroppin\u2019 songs faster than a virgin when the pussy wet\nTo swim into the mainstream with the sharks so I can come up next\nEminem done paved the path, 'Pac saw me in a dream\nMe and Drake from Canada, fuck you think that all mean\nIn my opinion, I think that means that I'm the next best thing\nEating, beasting\nNow I'm motherfuckin' top shit\nFuck niggas don't wanna problem when I pop shit\nGas niggas like I'm in a chamber this is Auschwitz\nAll drip my bars coming out a faucet, faucet\nThe crazy thing about this rap is 'bout the recognition\nUnderrated is an understatement and I'm the definition\nContemplated if I should kill 'em, I had a premonition\nRonald Reagan the whole game and cause a demolition\nNiggas finna nut like Dontai, ooh\nBrought my skill to Cali like Lebron James, ooh\nKnow she wanna fuck and her friend do too\nKSI a bitch, get mentioned, views\nNah, but real shit, lil' nigga, don't you ever try to diss me or I'll come for ya neck\nI'll be damned if an Uncle Tom corny ass nigga making vlogs try to talk if he ain't showin' respect\nSo let me break it down for you how I live out the rest of my whole career\nI promise I'mma be one of the biggest in about a year\nI promise I'll be the one to convince you that thing fear\nIs a concoction by the devil to make the good disappear\nI promise I'll win a Grammy, I promise I'll win an Oscar\nI promise the rap game won't turn me into a monster\nAnd force the people who love me to treat me like I'm a sponsor\nAnd pray for my death for money and not for a life longer\nAnd that's facts (That's facts)\nManifested all this shit through rap (Through rap)\nSpoke my life into existence, I was workin' in the trenches, swear to God that I ain't ever going back\nOT 613 put it on the map\nTreat a beat like 50, had to get the strap\nKSI wanna beat me, nigga you can CC the fee fee is 10k if you want a track\nSo you gon' watch me on the TV, nigga\nI swear to God they gon' keep this shit on repeat, nigga\nLike four, five, six times, best believe me, nigga\nI'm gon' thrive 'cause the boy be a cheat sheet, nigga\nThey gon' ride, ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ride\nNiggas talk shit, they gon' di-i-ie\nIf I ain't the best then that's a li-i-ie\nYou can peep the drip, I'm not dry-y-y\nNow ya boy be the topic\nJoyner Lucas gotta hit me, we can rock shit\nTory Lanez, you a singer. just stop it\nI'm a triple threat, nigga, on God shit, on God shit, God shit, yeah\nThat's right, I can do that too\nThis is shit is easy for a nigga like 2x2\n4 mill on Rap God, that was just last week\nEminem, let me hop on a beat, it's Dax\nYou might also like[Outro]\nKi-Ki-Ki-Ki-Ki-Killswitch\nThese pussy niggas gon' feel this\nYeah, they know that I'm the realest10Embed"

(What if?)\nWhat if we make it to heaven and don't get inside? (What if?)\nWhat if we get to the gates and see God on the other side and he looks us in our face and says our whole lives we've wasted time?\nWhat if we can't go back? (What if?)\nWhat if we can't redo this life and get one second chance?\nWhat if our future happiness is memories of our past (God)\nWhile we burn forever haunted by the devil's laughs? (Hahahaha)\nWhy?\nWhy do we push them away? (Why?)\nAnd why do the ones we work to keep never actually stay? (Why?)\nWhy do we focus on tomorrow and forget about today (Why?)\nAnd smile in everybody's face and try and act like we're okay?\nWhy do we live this way?\nWhy do we hate?\nWhy do we fight?\nWhy do we act like there's time and got more than one life?\nWhy? (Answer me)\nWhy? WHY!? Why? Why?\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI'm older and looking for truth\nI'm holding my faith in my hand but the pain in this world has been shaking it loose\nI used to have so much to gain\nNow I have so much to lose\nThey say I'm crazy for looking for answers\nI say they crazy for not giving proof\nVision is blurred, I'm over concerned\nI'm looking at God to see if life with him is something I've earned\nThe devil's been watching he's tryna recruit he's been waiting at every turn\nI'm driving this life on the highway to hell but I won't burn, fuck!\nWe know the difference\nWe know what is wrong and we know what is right\nBut Satan is strong, God, and most of your people are losing the fight (We try)\nSo what if we fail?\nWhat if we can't escape his lies? (What if?)\nWhat if we can't change, what if he still controls our minds?\nWhere do we run?\nWhere do we go?\nWho do we talk to?\nWe look around and everyone we see is lost too (Fuck)\nWhat if life was just some test that we all do? (What if?)\nWhat if you were busy when we called you?\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat if hell's on earth?\nWhat if being born is dying, and dying's birth?\nWould that mean life's not God's gift but the devil's curse?\nAnd to live was to be evil 'cause it's words reversed?\nWhat if the devil entered a pastor and he led a church?\nWhat if we looked for the truth, but didn't know where to search? (Where?)\nWhat if the books they said to read had never been your words? (What if?)\nWhat if we chose to follow you but we still had that urge?\nWill you forgive us for our sins and let us in your world?\nGod we at the gates (What if?)\nWe couldn't see, hear, or touch you, but we had faith\nWe know we messed up, we human and we make mistakes\nSo we just begging we get in and that you'll have grace (Please)\nGod!\nWhat if we didn't mean it?\nWhat if the place we grew up forgot to teach it?\nWhat if we never even got the chance to go and seek it?\nThen what, then what? (Then what?)\n[Outro]\nDear Family\nWe're in scary times\nNobody has the answers\nJust make sure we spread love\nAnd believe\nMy name is Dax1Embed"

What fuck is you telling me?\nNiggas sniffing methamphetamine\nYou niggas is d-d-d-d-d-dead to me\nYou cannot knock me off, this is d-d-d-d-d-destiny\nEspecially how I've done it and killed it all independently\nThey hated but could never assassinate my identity\nI'm g-g-g-genetically gifted\nI k-k-k-kill everything I touch, it's ridiculous\nFuck opinions, who gon' stop me, bitch?\nI'm going the distance\nI'm gonna finish, gonna win it\n2020, I'm blowing, I'm gon' get it (Ah!)\nThis shit incredible\nIf you don't show respect, I know you ain't no intellectual\nWhat goes around comes around, this shit perpetual\nI'm sick, I might need medical\nI'm bending words like Beckham\nMy bars be so damn flexible\nGet green just like a vegetable\nMy shit be so precise when I'm rapping, I'm using decimals\nMixing it like some chemicals\nI'm freestyling but might do this whole beat 'cause I'm extendable\nDo not try this at home, kids, it's only for us professionals, yeah\n[Outro]\nHaha\nIt's Dax\nHey, if you try to hate on this, go ahead and lick your hand\nAnd slap yourself1Embed"

Climbed mountains, wasn\u2019t afraid of the drop\nPut my city on the map with a bucket and a mop\nWhat you thought?\nThat I would pack up and quit?\nMy mom would slap me in the face say she ain't raise no bitch\n3rd chapter of the story now that broke boy rich\nBut his mentality ain't gon switch, fuck\nI guess I\u2019m on now I put my life into this music manifested what you see through all these songs now\nI cannot calm down\nThey tried to rain on my parade it's a brigade\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m walking through a storm now\nFuck what you gotta say, fuck mediocrity\n100 niggas tried not one is ever stopping me\nSpeak it to existence, yes, that is my philosophy\nI was born broke but refuse to die in poverty\nSee it\u2019s the law of attraction\nIf you think it you can have it\nIf you see it you can grab it\nIf you speak it then you put in the time, you build habits\nFuck average\nConvince yourself you can be the best fucker on the planet\nAnd you know this\nYou have to stay focused\nAnything could happen you could die at this moment\nYou only get one life to live so take it and own it\nYour biggest threat is yourself\nYou your biggest opponent\nThey gon' lie to your face and try to tell you you\u2019re broken\nDon\u2019t listen, God got you if your born you\u2019re chosen\nGet your life in motion\nStop dreaming, stop wishing, stop crying\nStart praying, start living, stop hoping\nYou remember me?\nThe one you picked last\nThe one that that you clowned\nSaid he was trash\nI took all of your comments then I put them in a bag\nThen I went and bought a bat and started beating on my craft\nI don\u2019t need no introduction\nMe losings out of discussion\nGet that stuck in your head just like concussions\nMy dreams chase me\nI woke up and stopped running\nLooked 'em dead in the eye\nYou should've knew that I was coming\nI ain't special if I can do it you can do it\nThis ain't mainstream rap, this is motivational music\nYou have talent please use it\nIt\u2019s yours just choose it\nStop sitting on the bench\nSub in and go stupid\nThen don\u2019t look back\nThis life is yours you must drive it you can\u2019t afford to crash\nYour futures brights you must light it\nYou must learn from your past\nIt goes by super fast\nForget a handout you don\u2019t need it get yo own back\nForget approval you don\u2019t need it you yo own man\nGo tell the world that you\u2019re the greatest then go own that\nTake yo soul back\nKeep yo head up in the rain\nSpeak yo life into existence become self proclaimed\nYou might also like[Outro]\nIf you need it\nI will be here in yo head speaking words you\u2019ll need if defeated\nYes, you can and you will, yes, just believe it\nYou great I swear I can see it\nIt's Dax\nGet up, and work\nCo-sign yourself4Embed"

    "plain": "\u201cThe Next Rap God 2\u201d is a sequel to Dax\u2019s June 2021 single of the same name. The song was released on November 23, 2021. It marks Dax\u2019s first release following the release of his debut studio album, Pain Paints Paintings, which released a month prior to this song\u2019s release.\n\nOn the track, Dax raps for twenty minutes on a wide variety of beats, all of which were produced by Pendo46 and LexNour Beats, proving himself that he is the next \u201cRap God\u201d, by rapping fast and using clever lyricism. It is currently Dax\u2019s longest song to date, however it is expected to get surpassed with a one hour long version, as teased on the track at the very end.\n\nOn November 22, Dax announced on his YouTube channel that if he wants the fans to hear new Dax\u2019s music.\n\nY\u2019all want BARS!? Or nah!? ONLY LIKE if you do. Choose WISELY because this is a WORLD RECORD BREAKING AMOUNT thAt will requIRE MONTHS TO BREAK DOWN\u2026\n\nIn the same post, Dax announced that the song will prove from the fans if he will continue to stay as an independent artist or will get signed to a major record label.\n\nIf this gets dropped you will ALL SOON be deciding whether I stay INDEPENDENT or SIGN to a MAJOR LABEL\u2026 it is what it is. I love u\u2026 my actions prove that \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nFollowing the release of the song and it\u2019s music video, on November 23, 2021, Dax announced both in the description of the song and in the very beginning of the video that if the song\u2019s music video can\u2019t reach up to 500,000 likes by the beginning of 2022, he will sign to a major record label.\n\nif this doesn\u2019t get 500k likes by Jan 1st i\u2019m signing to a major label\u2026\n\nThe music video did not reach the 500K goal, as it sits with a total of 287,000 likes, as of January 1, 2022. After months of silence, in September 2022, it was revealed that Dax had signed a record deal with Columbia Records."

       "plain": "\u201cThe Next Rap God 2\u201d is a sequel to Dax\u2019s June 2021 single of the same name. The song was released on November 23, 2021. It marks Dax\u2019s first release following the release of his debut studio album, Pain Paints Paintings, which released a month prior to this song\u2019s release.\n\nOn the track, Dax raps for twenty minutes on a wide variety of beats, all of which were produced by Pendo46 and LexNour Beats, proving himself that he is the next \u201cRap God\u201d, by rapping fast and using clever lyricism. It is currently Dax\u2019s longest song to date, however it is expected to get surpassed with a one hour long version, as teased on the track at the very end.\n\nOn November 22, Dax announced on his YouTube channel that if he wants the fans to hear new Dax\u2019s music.\n\nY\u2019all want BARS!? Or nah!? ONLY LIKE if you do. Choose WISELY because this is a WORLD RECORD BREAKING AMOUNT thAt will requIRE MONTHS TO BREAK DOWN\u2026\n\nIn the same post, Dax announced that the song will prove from the fans if he will continue to stay as an independent artist or will get signed to a major record label.\n\nIf this gets dropped you will ALL SOON be deciding whether I stay INDEPENDENT or SIGN to a MAJOR LABEL\u2026 it is what it is. I love u\u2026 my actions prove that \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nFollowing the release of the song and it\u2019s music video, on November 23, 2021, Dax announced both in the description of the song and in the very beginning of the video that if the song\u2019s music video can\u2019t reach up to 500,000 likes by the beginning of 2022, he will sign to a major record label.\n\nif this doesn\u2019t get 500k likes by Jan 1st i\u2019m signing to a major label\u2026\n\nThe music video did not reach the 500K goal, as it sits with a total of 287,000 likes, as of January 1, 2022. After months of silence, in September 2022, it was revealed that Dax had signed a record deal with Columbia Records."

   "lyrics": "50 ContributorsThe Next Rap God 2 Lyrics[Verse 1]\nTen minutes was the warmup, nigga, get in tune\nYou wanna beef? Let's meet, hit my Zoom\nI'm callin' shots, you in the bleachers mournin' every move\nI kill 'em with success, I'm up next like afternoon\nYou niggas evenin' the playin' scale, it's like the moon\nTryna sunset as the nightmare I rap resumes\nYou get eclipsed, and then I star in the movie (LexNour)\nWhere the underdog leaves the whol\u0435 game straight confused\nYou think you rappin' with a God, you must be crazy, nigga\nOn\u0435 song for my deluxe is all I need to do\nThese puppies barkin', they done bit off more than they can chew\nMy album just dropped, I'm already back for round two\nThis here for shits and giggles, here's an epiphany\nDax ain't droppin' music when he's rappin', he's droppin' symphonies\nI make Mozart than most, my key lyrically\nIs noted on a scale above the whole industry, it's Dax\nI got bars out in Georgia\nTwenty-minute songs'll probably Illinois ya\nI got PTSD from the killin's of these beats, I'm a veteran\nI came in the game like a soldier, I could sun you like Barbosa\nMe and Nash playin' soccer out in Canada, that's Trudeau\nI ain't never lied in my prime, how I minister the flow is unknown\nThey don't know where it's comin' from like phone calls with star 69\nThey say I say nothin', that I'm corny and outdated\nIf I rapped in the '90s, I'd probably be famous\nThat the flow and the cadence is abrasive\nI be blackin' out on beats, even niggas started callin' me a racist\nLike Aunt Jemima\nI need an Oscar, they admire my wiener\nThey blowin' me like Hurricane Katrina\nI get Superdome defenses tryna find a way to stop me\nI'm offensive with the wordplay, I minored misdemeanors\nBitch, you might need a subpoena to see me, like John Cena\nHigh jab ya, huh, then wrap you like a turban\nPack a Stan in a can and ship him to Eminem\nAnd say \"Dax needs a feature\" and pray that it's not a burden, why?\nBecause I rap in cursive\nThey treat my lyrics like the Bible, the OG and the King James Version\nThis colloquial, my verses speak 'hood and suburban\nSo the people in the 'jects still respect my sermons\nMerge it, LeapFrog it, Kermit\nYou want a pass, you'll need a permit\nLyrically, I'm drivin' drunk how I'm swervin'\nIn and out of genres, I ain't pop or urban\nI'm my own category, you can call that shit purpose, listen\nI need to get this off my chest\nYou a bitch if I'm rappin', and you say you not impressed\nYour input does not add money to my check\nWho the fuck about to do this and not even break a sweat?\nMan, they committin' genocide tryna exterminate the lyricist\nWhile saying Dax is the antithesis\nThat's means opposite, but if I'm the opposite\nThen how am I independent and the game's still profitin'?\nIt's not supposed to happen, they cappin'\nI'm a goddamn savage when rappin'\nGas mask yo' casket 'cause the smoke I spit will give you lung damage\nIf you wanna come and grab what I'm grabbin', you'll have to lift weights and wait\n'Cause the tectonic plate shift I create is so great\nThat by the time you reach me the earthquakes\nThe booth was my birthplace, I'm used to the static\nThey say I got drive, I'm auto-matic\nAin't listenin' to demos, especially not 'cratics\nThese niggas panic like we at the disco\nI got a simple plan for you\nWe should rage against the machine, I'ma need a team\nI'm two and a half men myself, like Charlie Sheen\nThis industry's sick, Dax is the vaccine\nTop five in this bitch, at least the past three\nIf they say otherwise, they anti-vaccine\nAnd the mandate passed suppresses they free speech\n'Cause I'm in a different category\nMy whole life is a allegory\nThe truth I speak is a double-edge\nAnd that's why there's no matrimony\nEverybody knows what I came to do\nSo they separate and the alimony\nIs why I'm broke, but I don't care because my impact is mandatory\nIn a age of fake and I'm perplexed by the hate\nWhy flex in your songs if they carry no weight?\nIf my shit's trash but spreads at this rate\nThen maybe it's you who has no taste\nAnd I don't normally pray, but today I'll say\nDear God, please wash these lames away\nAnd ironically, that's the name of my song\nThat's gold with no fuckin' radio play\nNow it's back to the topic, let me hit you wit' a switch\nHow the fuck I'm pussy if you always on my dick?\nI don't rap about the typical, my money or a bitch\nAnd if I ever do flex, I'm in the gym doin' lifts\nI don't pack nothin' but six, my abs stay ripped\nI'm like an ad lib, bitch, I stay in the mix\nEvery time I see a beat in my scope, it's a hit\nState of mind like a shooter for the New York Knicks\nI'm the best, and if they ask Kawhi like the Clips\nTell 'em Dax got a glove with the game in his grip\nThrowin' counter punches, hooks, metaphorically the shit\nLike a potty mouth nigga with a stank upper lip, and\nThis wasn't planned\nI'm spittin' facts from a real-world scan\nThey cable, I'm streamin', they nice\nBut the difference, they can't do it on demand, I'm the man\nB-b-bombin' on these beats if you tally up the bands\nGot enough ammunition to supply the Taliban\nEvery bar is like a bullet, they go doo-doo!\nPeople try to Dodge, but they can't like a fuckin' caravan\nOkay, now I'm warmed up, I can feel the sweat\nThe bars drip and turn complex\nHit the floor as I gas the beat, then evaporate and condense\nIn a generation where common sense is not common sense\nWe need a real rapper, but when you say Nas\nThey think you mean Lil Nas X and that's not a diss\nI don't want to get canceled, YouTube, don't take my channel\nDon't copyright, 'cause if you do I'll strike and beat at you\nI'm sick and somethin' you can't handle\nI'm solar like a panel\nYou can't desert me like a camel\nI was built for this and somethin' they cannot dismantle\nMan, this is appallin', I bounce back like Spalding\nI slide on these beats, my flows icy and my bars toboggans\nIf rap's a house, I'm home alone like Macaulay Culkin\nAnd if you think you better, then rap about it and stop talkin', hot doggin'\nI actually play basketball\nI'm gettin' buckets if they ever say that Dax ballin'\nI see them postin' who's the best hoop rap artist\nLike I ain't led a whole goddamn college conference\nThis shit is wild, I see the posts and profiles\nBut commentin' negativity is not my style\nI got a strap and I ain't talkin' 'bout a gun\nIt's a hoop term, dummy, go ahead, you can check my file\nI been squeaky clean, see, I don't want to go to jail\nBut if I did, I know it'd triple all my sales\nAnd that's the fucked up part about this life\nDon't nobody wanna see you do good 'til you goin' through hell\nAnd that's why I had to make this\nTwenty-minute rap song, I'm 'bout to one-take it\nI just made my first album\nFull of songs from the depths of my heart, and these people didn't appreciate it\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nI should've rapped about guns and violence\nOr fuckin' bad bitches on an island\nOr some drugs that I don't even take, heh\nThen tell all the kids to try it\nMan, what's its gon' take to make it?\nFor them to say that I'm one of the greatest?\nDo I gotta go sell my soul?\nAnd live the rest of my life forsaken?\nDon't push me, 'cause I just might do it\nI go dumb, but I've never been stupid\nI've had nothin' in my life before, and I was fine\nSo bitch, I'm not afraid to lose it\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo, fuck this music, I don't need it\nCall me cocky or call me conceited\nSmooth criminal, I'm a demon\nI Mike Jacked 'em, now they gotta beat it\nI throw up hits, heh, I'm bulimic\nShoutout to Drake\u2014why? I stay schemin'\nStarted from the bottom, now the views I'm seein'\nMean nothin' was the same, and I'm no longer dreamin'\nMan, this already a classic, yeah\nI'm the future, so you can't look past it\nIf you take that mask off you could tell that I'm the baddest\nReport cards the only time in life you'll see Dax beside the word average\nAnd I bet you I'm above, go add 'er all together, I ain't talkin' bout the drug\nAnd you know it's orange juice if they say a C-plus\nIf you think I'm a 50 then you got no sense like the famous rap song that is called \"In Da Club\"\nCalm down, let me bust a rhyme and kick flips while I'm on my grind\nI got tricks up my sleeve, I could make a simile disappear like the line inside this line\nAnd every time I rhyme, they see an Optimus in his prime\nI transform, I could reach the blind\nMy mind's design is one of a kind, you'll find\nThere is no one like I and that is I why\nI must keep it goin', constant motion, locomotive\nI lack promotion, I provoke 'em\nBreak down every system but still be growin'\nSo sick that they might need some Ibuprofen\nOff the deep end, bars with the depths of oceans\nSub-zero flow, so you know it's frozen\nIQ so high feels like I'm smokin'\nMost impotent man who is spittin' potent\nFace off with The Rock like a real Samoan\nTech N9ne with the chop, Midwest influence\nThat's congruent, payin' my respects, I'm never out of pocket\nName another young gun who is this polished\nI spit fury, entice 'em with this rocket\nBars get to droppin' everywhere like I'm bronze bombin'\nYou couldn't put me in a box if we boxin'\nBTS shots the only time Dax K-poppin'\nStick on my hip, I'll clean the whole room\nBut don't be alarmed, it's Dax, I'm just moppin'\nThat's off-topic, let me tell you somethin' real\nEverything you see now was done with no deal\nWhat does that mean? It's fuck how you feel\n'Cause it's impossible to get this far with no skill (Skill, skill, skill, skill, skill, skill)\n[Bridge]\nNever mind, you won't find no one like me\nI wish\n\n[Verse 3]\nThat you would see me for what I am\nInstead of ignorant top comments you see on the 'Gram\nI'm a once-in-a-lifetime type of man\nWho actually cares 'bout the content and all the fans\nI guess it doesn't matter, they piss poor, weak bladder\nI gotta keep them at bay like the Packers\nDon't stare 'cause you'll need a ladder\nThey pass words around like computer hackers\nI'm built different, I was never breastfed\nWhen I was two years old, I was dropped on my head\nIn school like Dej Loaf, they'd try me\nBut just like the second part of her name, I was all about the bread\nSo, I stayed focused, I couldn't afford to fumble\nWrestlin' demons in my bed like the Royal Rumble\nPaid dues, they ain't never gave me a bundle\nBut they discount people who would fuckin' mumble\nThis life is not fair, they dread Dax like Jamaican hair\nBecause they know they can't compare\nThen stock my work and resell it on the market\nAnd give Dax no shares\nWhat the fuck? I'm 'bout to slide like a hockey puck, duck like Donald\nShoot like LeBron and tax niggas like Obama\nDo the stanky leg and heat it up like a sauna\nWhile you talk to yo' God and have to deal with yo' karma\nAs-salamu alaykum, I come in peace\nI love all religions and practice what I preach\nIf you came into this world and you bleed, you're like me\n'Cause love is my religion, and I love what I see\nI'm not a Christian rapper, I just rap about faith\nWithout takin' the Bible and throwin' it in your face\nAnd ironically, when you do it that way\nMore people end up saved\nI paved my way by scrapin' it\nYou ain't never seen a nigga like me, if you did, I guarantee they was on some label shit\nThey want me to leaf, I'm not rakin' it, twenty minutes, bitch, this my statement\nHalfway and I'm just warmin' up, now I'm 'bout to freak this like some pussy I'm playin' with\nI'm 'bout give you that energy, uh\nThey know Dax sick, but he also the remedy, yeah\nIf they say I'm trash they smokin' methamphetamine, yeah\nThis here my destiny, yeah\nPussy nigga, you an enemy, never was a friend to me\nHundred different flows like a muthafuckin' centipede, it's Dax!\nMy path's a lonely road, I walk alone, and I keep my eyes closed\nI don't fuck wit' you broke hoes, I'd rather jack off inside my home\nI can already see the fake, they rise quick then fall like Easy Bake\nThen resurrect like Christ on Easter Day, they straight ass, I ain't talkin' about a piece of cake\nUh, I'm turnin' up the concentration\nFree in this bitch, but I'm not a mason\nCame in the game and the beats I'm blazin'\nBring heat that'll torch and destroy the matrix\nLine after line, got 'em snortin' greatness\nRaw spelt backwards is what I'm wagin'\nDax is the brand and the occupation\nOccupies the real so the constant hatin'\nComes from the fake who deny the basic\nThat Dax is a part of the conversation\nWith no cosign or major playlists\nRadio play or talent agent\nAnger and rage 'cause they can't contain it\nStraight to top, and the spot is vacant\nThose who oppose go straight to hell, hah\nAnd go twerk with Satan\nI'm spittin' it mad fast, I ain't gonna backtrack\nMy flow's in a hazmat, I'm fixin' to blow\nGame in a backpack, they spittin' the rap cap\nThey know what they doin', and they tryna be clones\nI'm ice cold, no Steve Stone\nUnless you're in Austin, Texas\nWWE, you niggas restless\nYou are not getting in, you're not on my guest list\nDon't fit like Tetris, I'm 'bout to make this flip\nAnybody hatin' can come and suck my dick\nEverything I spit is like glue, it sticks\nWhen you poop's the only time you're the shit\nEverybody wanna just get rich\nYou're all my sons just like Chris\nI'm appalled 'cause you always miss\nAnd if you hit, you still can't do it like this\nAnd if you did your brain would explode, I'm next to blow\nI'm a whole series, you're just an episode\nGimme legume, heh, like a vegetable\nBeatin' me is a stretch, you better get flexible\nKillin' this beat, but the crime is sensible\nFirst-degree, I murder thee, then mastermind then PhD\nMy schemes are credible\nSo the rhymes may not be detectable\nOver heads, they go and fall on deaf ears\nThe buzz I made's beyond lightyears\nSo when they're toxic like Britney Spears\nI barely hear 'cause I just switch gears\nYou ain't never seen a rapper strike this much fear\nAmongst his foes and his so-called peers\nSo, like Visine drops, let me make this clear\nI'm Dax, and I been in a different tier\nAnd it's fire, fire, call for help\nMy desire burns and they passion melts\nIndependent, so I might not be felt\nBut I sign my checks, that's a higher self\nDon't pull my card 'cause you might get dealt\nMy hand of God's from the Bible Belt\nMy wave's so big even Michael Phelps\nCan't swim my shit without some help\nSo breathe, huh-huh, huh-huh\nYou might need a second to catch up\nDax is on a tear, and they're lookin' for backup\nSemi-automatic, and I hit like a Mack truck\nBreathe, huh-huh, huh-huh\nAnd I don't give a flying fat fuck\nYes, I am a sinner, and I drink and do cuss\nBut like DJ Khaled, I got the keys\nTo unlock the beast\nExtend my reach from down beneath\nAnd knock off those who cannot compete\nBut want to act like they can fuck with me\nIt's OK-K-K like racial tension\n\"Dax nice, let's avoid him and never mention\nHe'll elevate to a new dimension\nAnd leave us here in the kiddy section\"\nSixty-five metaphors, where's my pension?\nI retire beats and they go to heaven\nAppraise them, not like a reverend\nI mean raise their value\nI'm still here like a statue starin' at you, I will stand the test of time\nAnd if I sit I'll still be twice as tall with my head in the sky\nLookin' down at all you birds\nWho talk on Twitter thinkin' there's power behind your words?\nCallin' me corny behind your computer in the fuckin' suburbs\nHahahaha, hahahahaha, haha\nYou're way too late, heh I've mastered this, and now I'm better than great, heh heh, uh\nIn fact, I might just be top five all-time, or at least top ten, well, maybe nine\nMinus five, divided by two, minus the amount times we all get to live this life\nThat's one, don't waste it\nYou'd be way more successful with Dax on your playlist\n'Cause I rap about motivation, which you lack\n'Cause if you focused on yourself, you wouldn't have time to go online, spend your time there, heh, just to shit on Dax\nOh, it's sad, you know I've never had someone more successful tell me I'm wack\nAnd, oh, I forgot I'm black so I'm supposed to rap about guns, bitches, clothes, and tons of cash\nWhile you pricks pray I lose my shit, while you sit at home and clap\nAnd that's the kicker, heh\nYou don't even get paid to hate, heh, heh on Twitter, heh\nIt just makes you bitter, and my skin gets thicker and it actually promotes my work\nIndirectly and over a period of time you sheep herd and all just make me richer\nI got you in a bind like a boa constrictor\nI'm on the way up like a zipper and only fade in the cut with a pair of clippers\nBut I'm no clown, my shit's real\nAnd that's why despite how you feel, it all still spreads around\nUp and down with resoundin' sound\nEven haters got to admit that Dax got that bounce\nBoy, you better run home when you see me, I don't mean a baseball mound\nI'm the king in this bitch, that's why I let my hair grow in the shape of a crown\nYou better bow down then get up, I won't let up or let go\nI take the hate they throw and embody it for the energy to go turn up at my sold-out shows across the globe\nSouth Africa, Nigeria\nZambia, Liberia\nCanada, I need Expedia\nAnd, oh, I got a message for the media\nI don't care if that fake shit feedin' ya\nYou a sellout if you glorify that trash that does not meet the criteria\nI'm a patriot, I've united states\nEvery bill I check got Buccs and nears Tom Brady's throw completion rate\nThat's a bar, if you don't get it\nBut if you did, I have to explain for those who still give me no credit\n[Bridge]\nWell, well, well, actually I've got my I got my own money\nI've always been a big advocate for debit\n\n[Verse 4]\nI don't obsess over what's not mine, I already think I'm great\nThey whine about Dax like a large amount of grapes\nThen act pregnant like they made me and I popped out way too late\nAnd they never ever recovered from postpartum baby weight\nThat's not my fault, I did my job and made waves like Rod\nI put my heart on ice, and if you slip and fall, I hope you break your jaw\nSo you can't talk at all and have to cry\nOh, I'm gettin' off track, or maybe I should just go and finish that like No Life Shaq\nYou want to know what pisses me off the most?\nPeople wanna pretend that they can do what I do\nDrop these tracks back-to-back with impeccable raps\nStay humble, move how I move\nHit it on the nail, you're a loose screw\nAin't nobody fuckin' with me in this booth\nIt's a blatant lie if they try to say I'm not the truth\nInspirational, all relatable, undebatably one of a kind\nIntrinsic fire lit inside to match my grind\nCritical thinkin' songs that actually make you think about your life\nFuck attention spans, my music actually stands the test of time\nI don't give a fuck about a Grammy, I should've had three\n\"Dear God\", \"JOKER\", \"Book of Revelations\"\nBut these motherfuckers don't want to give it to emcees\nJust glorify and push the shit that's empty\nI'm at large in this bitch like a Starbucks Venti\nCertified-killer, promise you don't want to tempt me\nGot the game in a state of rage, a frenzy\nIf they're speaking on my name and hate, it's envy\nI ain't missin' my target unless I'm shoppin' for some bananas\nI'm at c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-coco cabanas\nK-k-killin' these comics c-c-comin' at me with cameras\nDon't c-c-c-c-call me 'less you callin' Colin, you cappin'\nI'm a c-c-c, c-c-chemist c-c-cookin' everything\nYou c-cook 'cause I'm a menace\nDax is a Clause like Santa, but independent\nMy world is a series, I don't mean the Pennant, heh\nThey probably think that I'll run out of bars\nBut I'm a galaxy, and I got as many as the stars\nI'm an extraterrestrial alien and I'm on Mars\nAnd I'm comin' back to Earth to rid you of these retards\nMan, I hope they don't cancel me for that\nCancel culture is a bitch\nYou can say anything you want\nAs long you're not rich\nBut if you're poor, oh, they might get you, too\nBecause if you ever become successful, they'll use your past against you\nWe can't even be human, we can't even make mistakes\nEveryone's a dick, but won't come say it to your face\nWe spend our lives looking left and right while we run our race\nThen wonder why we're depressed and always finish shit in second place\nGet up and get gone, you ain't right if you're doin' nothin' wrong\nGet off of that phone, find out Korea like Kim Jong-Un\nFind your passion and cash in like Kim Kardashian\nAnd bask in the fact that it takes action to be a massive attraction\nAnd stay active instead of bein' passive, reach out and go grab it and make habits\nFuck status, you'll stay static, just march, no madness\nThis bracket is an elite synapsis, all info passed has been imagined\nNo draggin' if you wanna get cash then start smashin'\nInstead of waitin' 'til you're in a casket\nAnd braggin' on what happened in the past\nOf your life as the basic average\nBe a savage, attack it, rip it, slash it, cremate it\nTake its ashes and smoke it, gas it so hard that the pedal smashes\nStop livin' in captions, you're better than that, you have it, addict\nLike Go-Go Gadget, you're equipped to wreak havoc, emphatic\nI'm 'bout to weaponize a generation\nThis road I'm blazin' got my enemies wishin' they had never tried to  crack the pavement\nPoetic justice, everybody's here in my arraignment\nMurder to Goliath, and I am fuckin' David\nYou couldn't save 'em with the flash drive\nDon't question a Mark, he a snitch if you ask why\nWhole generation lost, you can check the spectrum\nMy connection isn't there like they low-bar WiFi\nI'm not a part of this shit, I'll never celebrate ignorance\nI'm on the border like undocumented immigrants\nTryna decide if I should stay in the village\nOr risk it to benefit but have to move militant\nIf you're hatin', you're a child\nYou don't understand the Dax impact, and you won't for a while\nBut once you get old, and this life gets real\nYou'll wanna go back and wish my words touched you like a pedophile\nYou must be crazy if you think I'ma stop\nI was hip without hip-hop\nBetween the lines, I could read the signs\nThey don't want music, they want songs that'll get a whole generation locked\nSo, I stay back and push my little positive message\nIsolated from the game up in the nosebleed section\nNo awards or recognition, but my state of correction\nFacilitates the people chained to get a bit up in heaven\nAnd that's a felony\nEven amnesia couldn't make them not remember me\nThe word meme is short for memories\nSo, when you tryna break what I've made\nKeep in mind you helpin' me build a legacy\nAnd that's why I'm right in they face, somethin' they cannot erase\nTake copy and paste, penning these verses and eight\nThe penmanship I exude is of dystopian taste\nCharacterized by world issues full of drama and pain\nMe, Picasso, and Da Vinci are of similar grain\nThe reality I paint is vivid, wicked, ingrained\nInto the skull of every human who allows me to take\nThem on a trip where the pictures aren't perfectly framed\nCrooked, cracked and maimed, full of anger and rage\nSpat on with graffiti, lit in fiery flames\nFrom the mind of a human who is fuckin' deranged\nAnd goin' down in history as one of the greats\nAnd that's a fact\nAnd to think this all came from an epiphany\nOvernight janitor to poet to songs to moments\nAnd now, finally, symphonies, it's Dax\n\n[Refrain]\nFuckin' up everybody who put me in a category\nThinkin' I was never gonna make it\nIf we talkin' 'bout the lyrics or the cadence or the meanin' of the songs\nThere's not another approachin' what I've been makin'\nI've been sittin', waitin', innovatin', I'm patient, I'm waitin' to bust\nDeliberatin' on what I should come and beat in the cut\nPeople say that they better, they better never endeavor\nOr even sever the lever to try to get a go\nGet a second amendment, aggressive in every direction\nSpit venom, there's no defendin', I'll tell I'm independent\nPennin' with vengeance, the time on attention is iridescent\nAnd shinin' like the brighter luminescent\nAnd I'm tired of lululemon retention, first go, second-guessin'\nThey get to bendin' like back on my Dax, kickin' the definition\nOf bods, and riddin' the fold, hawks, and pick us up\nWith the claws, and grippin' with the intention of deficit\nAnd disorder like ADD, kinda sorta and I soda-popped\nDon't mean cola, a Star War don't mean Yoda\nA Florida, Pensacola, there's more to roll-a by Motorola\nI'm in control-a, I hit the quota\nI made this beat sound while I was in Minnesots\u2014\n\n[Outro: Dax & LexNour]\nFuck, fuck! Minnesota\nWhat are we at? What are we at, bro?\nTwenty minutes, man\nHa, for real?\nFor real, bro\nHeh, heh, oh, alright, well\nLet's try one that's an hour, heh3Embed"

Go, home!\nBut, but, I wanna try\u2005too!\nDon't\u2005cry?\nAlright, alright, hurry\u2005up, hurry up, c'mon\nJust, just don't\u2005fuck it up\n\n[Verse]\nOn point like an HP pencil\nI could talk\u205fshit\u205fbut\u205fI just got\u205fdental\nThat head was\u205fa little insane, her IQ EQ'd all of my mental (Oh!)\nThese niggas say I can't make hooks, this Peter Pan flow 'bout to captain this tempo\nAnd make you go crash 'cause the way my car dash\nIt'll make you go Kim and K-Kylie your Kendall (Oh my god!)\nI short bust, my nuts are still special\nI got sauce to beef with your pesto\nYou can't chest the problems I shoulder\nMy leg up ensures I'm up next (necks) so\nWon't stop throwing bars\nI'm green bay to farve\nMy soup(er) bowls'll heat up your end zone\nMicrowave and blaze your credentials\nWash away and MJ your skin tone (Shit)\nWhat's poppin'?\nIf I'm not, bitch, you toxic\nIf you can make a song with no hook and make it go viral\nPlease, bitch, drop it\nThrowing up hits, get it? I vomit\nThrowing up bricks, get it? You're onyx\nMy bars poke ya, mon'\nDon't get in the way when I come through the lane and start jammin'\nSmoking this beat like a Rastafarian\nHad to fish my drip just to acquire-em'\nGet it? Aquarium, fish, water\nHad to work hard just to drip harder\nCut the beat then slowly fade it in like a middle-class neighborhood barber (Fuck!)\nLet's pause it\nI'm 6 feet like the space recommended for COVID\n19 bars already put this beat in a coffin\nIf you say you're better, you're KAP like Colin\nIf you want a feature, text us like Austin, we will reply in August!\n2 guns in my pocket\nSee these? (CDs?) You better walk, man!\nI'ma Bodman (Batman) how this beat I'm Robin\nI'm cold but I'm not common\nI'm in this bitch\nOne stroke to the hole but I'm not fucking, bitch, I'm golfing\nPeople say they could do better, they just talking\nI'm about to toss 'em\nI'm not sold on you but the way I celt-ic, I could live in Boston\nThese bars don't come around too often\nThey connect like Sprint, ketchup, bitch, why are you jogging?\nYou mustard, I'm a YouTube rapper\nWell, if I am, then why ain't I vlogging?\nThat's what they try to say and stop him\nBut his punchlines won't let them box him in\nMy mic's enticing (Mikes in Tyson) them to think this holyfield is a boxing ring (Ugh)\nGod, what's the point of rapping these words?\nI would probably make more money if I spent all my time doing what the mainstream prefers\nBut I ain't finna follow the sheep inside that herd\nOne hit'll make 'em wonder when I spit my verse\nNiggas thinking that they rapping wit' me is absurd\nI be preying on these beats but I'm not in no church\nI'm due like rent on the 1st of the month\nBruce Lee with the flips, bitch, I do my own stunts\nThese nigga get (MOON)ED when I come through\nSo ass, they could probably be my suns\nI'm bout to get technically technical\nSo many flows, I be rapping with tentacles\nIf after this, you're still skeptical\nI will have to set you straight like a heterosexual\nMy wordplay's highly impeccable\nSo impeccable\n90 percent of the bars in this song are not even detectable\nAnd if you did hypothetically, you wouldn't see how they're three-dimensional\nWhat's poppin'? If I'm not by 2021, this rap game's garbage\nI don't remix beats, I kill them then I pay homage\nMy bars link like sausage\nI always hit it on the nail like polish\nThis rap shit's gotta be my calling\nI go\nBing, bing, bing, bing!\nBitch, I finished college\nHow do you think I got all this knowledge?\nShooting it up, yeah, the nigga was ballin'\nGetting my cheese like I'm out in Wisconsin\nI went bing, bing, bing!\nHow am I finished? I ain't even started\n'Bout to go dumb like I'm going retarded\nIf you talk rap, I go the hardest (Yeah)\nRapping is critical\nI embody each and every word and every syllable\nI put all of me inside in each and every visual\nI'm addicted to working, you're barely seeing my pinnacle\nMental and all the physical\nSo I'm never divisible\nIf you thought I was, you're dirty and pitiful\nYou can go and get a knife and cut off all of your genitals\nHow I come with this lyrical\nMakes me damn near invincible\nIf they wanna battle, they can't win!\nHow I come in is criminal\nMake a hater feel miserable\nWhen I get up and do my dance!\nYou don't gotta say it no more\nWe all know that I'm bringing that stamina\nEating beats like an animal\nNAIJA boy outta Africa\nGrew up hooping in Canada who used to be a ja\u2014\nYou might also like[Outro]\nJan-janit\u2014\nY'all finish the sentence9Embed"

The song correlates with the previous song on the album \u201cLove Hurts\u201d and outlines how the girl tricked Dax multiple times. The girl depicted in \u201cLove Hurts\u201d and \u201cMy Heart Hurts\u201d could be the same girl Dax referenced in his 2018 song \u201cShe Cheated Again\u201d."

The song correlates with the previous song on the album \u201cLove Hurts\u201d and outlines how the girl tricked Dax multiple times. The girl depicted in \u201cLove Hurts\u201d and \u201cMy Heart Hurts\u201d could be the same girl Dax referenced in his 2018 song \u201cShe Cheated Again\u201d."

I'm good, not much\nBut I noticed something was wrong\nCan't even look me in the eyes\nGot a tracker on your phone, I know that you've been telling lies\nGot the passwords to your shit, I see you texting other guys\nI got all the proof I need so why even deny?\nWho'd you fuck?\nIt's on my head you have to tell me, I can't give it up, no\nI think about it every day, I cannot go to sleep\nI need to say\n\n[Chorus]\nMy heart hurts in the worst possible way\nYou came first but now we have to go our separate ways\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nAnd then I went and took you back\nMy boy said I was crazy that you'd do it again and that you'd manipulate me\nI didn't listen, thought that I knew better\nThought if I left that I could never do better\nFirst love, first time I'm sick, she got a spell on me\nThat girl's a fucking witch, she casted hell on me\nI feel like I'm a bitch, this is a shell of me\nFool me once, shame on you\nYou fool me twice, now I'm looking like a fool\nMy head hurts and I don't know what to do\nI made this song to say\n\n[Chorus]\nMy heart hurts in the worst possible way\nYou came first but now we have to go our separate ways\n\n[Outro]\nI hope you hear this\nI hope you hear this\nI hope you hear this\nI hope you hear this\nI hope you hear this2Embed"

Cole the way I diss niggas\nFactual facts, factually fictionalizing what niggas say in they raps\nI dissected every word that you had said in the past\nAnd I'm convinced the insecurity stems from a man who doesn't know\nSo, I will educate and I will help you grow\nTo be the best is more than similes, metaphors and flows\nIt's the ability to enter in a motherfucker's soul\nAnd then repair it and release it to the motherfuckin' globe\n\n[Verse 3]\nMan, come on Tory\nWhy you lyin' to these niggas?\nWhy you claim you the best? What you hidin' from these niggas?\nGet that shit up off your chest and we'll still ride wit' you nigga\nBoy, you better show respect, 'Pac died for you nigga\nYeah, in a different category, married to the game you now divorced and payin' alimony\nI am not a saint, this is not a holy matrimony\nI am not your peer, I was made inside a laboratory\nI'm from the same country this a family feud\nYeah, I love you like a son and I know Drake does too\nThe bloods thicker than the water, so I'll tell you the truth\nYou will never be the best, you are not that dude\nBut don't worry you will still be rich\nFuck every girl and probably bang every bitch\nHave niggas down to ride, until the day you quit\nHave girls sing along with you to all your shit\nNow let me tell you why I'm qualified, my quality is quantified\nI'm greatness in the makin' but it's actually personified\nA mammoth feastin' through a rap game famine\nBars immigrated caught up like you 21 Savage\nI am not the other people you battled, I won't get personal\nI rap and sing just like you, but it's purposeful\nDon Q let you live, Joyner murdered you\nI cut you up limb by limb, this shit is surgical, uh\nTo be the best, you have to speak on more topics than your riches\nI'm a rapper for the people, you a rapper for the bitches\nChangin' lives I will live and outlast\nBut as soon you stop rappin', you're a thing of the past\nJust another rapper waitin' on a check from a entity\nYou'll die and be forgotten, I will die and leave a legacy\nRap sing melodies, my cadence straight heavenly\nRap game savior, you infect it I'm the remedy\nThis out of reach I set the bar too high\nVertically challenged, you won't reach it even if you reply\nI got a fetish for dead bodies, I'll eat you alive\nTake your heart, drink your blood while I'm watchin' you die\nTory, this is tactical, highly mathematical\nDivided and subtracted you from thinkin' it was practical\nTo rap against a nigga who is versed and international\nAnd studied in the arts of killin' rappers who aren't rational\nYeah, so what you gon' say to 'Pac when I send you up to meet him up in heaven?\nHow you gon' explain that you claim you the best but ain't got nothin' to show for it on your damn record?\nWe don't care 'bout cars\nWe don't care 'bout clothes\nWe don't care 'bout money\nTory Lanez nigga we don't care 'bout none of that shit\nYou a prime example of a nigga who got it on the outside but inside you still ain't rich\nWe care 'bout impact, nigga did you give back?\nEvery time you rap, don't nobody feel that\nNigga, you a joke to think that you can sit amongst the greats\nAll the ones who here now, and the ones who paved the way\nFuck, huh\nMan, that should be me\nI'm the one who should be sayin' I'm the best\nI'm the one rappin' savin' lives underpaid, who ain't even fuckin' worried 'bout a motherfuckin' check\nIt's Dax\n[Outro]\nDear Tory Lanez\nI love you dog\nWe from the same country\nI didn't mean to do this to you\nBut you asked for it\nAnd Dax always delivers\nThis is a sport\nIt's your move12Embed"

    "plain": "KILLSHOT 2 is a single by Dax. This song depicts Dax killing off his 11 demons that were inside him for a long time. In the music video, it shows him killing them in different ways. Mostly how the fears didn\u2019t want to die. There is also one demon named, \u201cHaters\u201d and at the end who Dax tells to leave, but before he could get away, he was shot. Great analogy."

Mostly how the fears didn\u2019t want to die. There is also one demon named, \u201cHaters\u201d and at the end who Dax tells to leave, but before he could get away, he was shot. Great analogy."

Dax\u2019s target demographic is people who listen closely to lyrics rather than \u201cvibe\u201d (though the latter is very possible because he can execute a wide variety of flows). Thus, his songs, including \u201cTHE NEXT RAP GOD\u201d, are dense with double entendres, plays-on-words, puns, homophones, sudden changes in meter, and other lyircal/poetic skills which Dax claims elevate him to the status of rap God.\n\nThis style of rapping and rhyming SAT vocab words is also common in Eminem\u2019s music, who first coined the term \u201cRap God\u201d in his hit song.

I love criticism from fuckin' critics\nOnce I really get to rappin', I really hear fuckin' crickets\nEver since I started rappin' I'm gettin' green like it's spinach\nGryffindor!\nLiquor got me floatin' just like it's quittage\nVoldemort wasn't even this wicked\nListen, people, I got tricks up my sleeve\nEvery nigga wants this, but what niggas want, niggas don't need\nThey tried to cut me off, it did not work nor hurt, 'cause when I cut I don't bleed\nThey tried to put us in the ground but they didn't know we were seeds\nI've been through things you can't believe, everything I speak I will achieve\nI am a different breed of rapper, known to blast ya\nOverflowed with good vernacular\nBeat the game computer hacker\nTook the stairs then used a ladder\nScrews fell out then used a hammer\nUsed the hammer to advance a whole career\nThey can't abuse or even tamper\nEven scatter even shatter\nEven after I am gone in the rafters\nMy top 5 consists of the top guys\nMe, me, me, me, and me as the top guy\nI do not connect with you niggas no Wi-Fi\nYou fake, what rhymes? Sci-fi\nI'm about to murder this beat like a drive-by\n10-minute rap, leave nothing in the archive\nYou niggas rap but really only part-time\nI'm about to separate myself like apartheid\nI'm built to last, I'm built to kill, I will not stop, I cannot stop\nI never will, they call me trash, I hear their words, I cannot feel\nI'm full of anger, pop a pill, a metaphor for numbing pain with skillful skill\nI love the thrill, the rush, the chill, I love the hate pre-requisite to bein' great\nYou hear my words, I hope they fuckin' resonate\nI got a rigorous regimen, when I'm spittin' it's venomous\nIf you're lookin' for evidence you can read it in genesis\nMe and Jesus had messages, so I guess that I'm relevant\nI wrote 5 of the chapters and finished off exodus\nYou rappers are feminine, you rappers have estrogen\nMe killin's a definite, I'm in my element\nAin't no comparison, rap game mine\nI'm a resident, should be the president\nReapin' eating all of the benefits aren't really that great\nMost people I meet are plastic fake\nThis industry's crazy, I'm goin' crazy\nI've felt that way since I moved to LA\nThese bitches won't work but wanna get paid\nI'm a rap god, bitch, come and get saved\nGot so much money in the bank I'll pay your rent\nAnd still not wanna get laid\nYou can hop on my wave but not on my boat\nYou can be on my team but not on my court\nYou can sit on that seat but not on my throne\nYou can be on my feed but not in my post\nYou niggas been sleep, Dax always been woke\nYou niggas been sprite, Dax always been coke\nYou break like threads, I hold like rope\nYou do not move 'til I say go GO\nNow let me explain my rap god qualities\nI give that in very large quantities\nWhat you do believe what is your hypotheses?\nI don't care, I say that modestly\nIf I had a metaphor for what I have in store\nFor four years of all this quality\nI would climb four floors all on my four fours\nStep forth full force and finish this prophecy\nI'm no Samaritan\nYou can't deport me like Donald Trump tried to do all of the Mexicans\nI'll skip a bar\nThen come back because I'm no perfectionist\nWho are you better than? Not me\nFuck, nigga, you can check my discography\nA nigga rappin' like a nigga hit the lottery\n3 years blew up I'm a prodigy\nNo indecision with my writtens, my flow, or my fuckin' vision\nMy style is really forbidden, forgiven out of position\nEverybody wanna rap, nobody really committed\nWanna be MJ, not willin' to play Pippen\nStay driven, you kiddin' niggas always gotta copy and fit in\nMy mission is to motivate youth, it doesn't pay well\nBut that's what real rap gods have to do\nSo, you wanna be a rap god?\nYou can't worry about what they say\nThey're lost, misguided sheep\nWho hate themselves more than you anyway\nSo you wanna be a rap god?\nStop worryin' 'bout everyone else\nGet on your grind\nIt's not their fault it's yours, go get that shit yourself!\nYou want to be a rap god, then rap with gods like me\nSnap hard and fuck up all these beats\nRap hard, redo, reuse, repeat\nGo to school hoop and work and pass on sleep\nBe independent, not codependent on labels with money engines\nAnd drop a new banger like every two damn weeks\nStay down! Real nigga like ten toes deep\nFrom the ground to yo head and back to yo feet\nIt's very competitive, niggas repetitive\nI kill it, consecutive, dippin' and dodging the negatives\nI'm sippin' adrenaline, niggas they fake, they edited\nI need to get credited, hate it or love it they're sensitive\nI'll never be sensitive your opinion's irrelevant, it does me no benefit\nOr add to percentages, I'll never be hesitant my success is not an estimate\nIt's evident I rap and I can- yeah\nSing melodically and still get technical\nYou're technically skeptical\nI'll skeptically let you know\nYour insecurities are highly detectable\nLike the NBA, I'm professional\nMy rhymes, they bend they're flexible\nSo perfect, so symmetrical\n10 minutes long, extendable\nWhat other rapper's doin' it like this? I'm righteous\nRap boomin', I can't fly now because I'm a flight risk\nPut my dick inside the game, it's too big, it's a tight fit\nNever made a bad song, they don't come out of my lips\nGot the game by the neck, won't let go I got tight grip\nI flip my flows like I'm doin' gymnastics\nAerobatics all over the place, I'm spastic\nDisappear, re-appear, my bars are like magic, elastic\nSucking you dry, you need cactus\nIn my prime, bugging you niggas, no mantis\nMy drip got drip, they drip like Atlantic\nTake a swim, I'm John, I can be your baptist\nMy bitch got ass, I do her like taxes\nBust twice paint her face like she was a canvas\nYour bitch fakes orgasms, she is a actress\nBorn March, no wonder I'm bringin' the madness\nGod dammit, I'm fucking amazin'\nI don't look left or right when I'm racin', I'm not complacent\nI chose this life it's mine, no trading stock risin', just like it's bakin'\nFuck you pigs, not talkin' bacon, paraphrasin'\nOnes who kill because they racist\nRosa Parking at your station, guns are blazin'\nLeave your balls just like they raisins\nMartin Luther King yo ass, then queen yo Freddie Jason\nMercerize your nation, leave you in a tub of man\nAnd Harriet the hairiest to train and slave you like enslavement\nSpeak the real and lose engagement\nTriple K than frosted flake\nAnd I'm the greasiest milk and shake it dirty monkey, bathe an ape\nAnd leave the world in shock amazement\nHow long can a rap god rap if a rap god's wrapped in a rap god's rap?\nAnd if the rap god snaps can the rap god rap if the rap god's rap is broken cracked?\nIn fact this rap god's rapidly rapping so fast he can't relax\nMy bars are futuristic intrinsic\nSo no they can't go back\nSo what they gonna say dawg?\nI did this in one take dawg\nAin't even take me the whole day dawg\nFlowing like Nate Dogg\nConcentration fu-fuck it I'm feeling just like Adolf\nBlow a nigga face off\nDon't see you niggas no Ray Charles\nSmh emoji the face palm\nDidn't even take long\nFuck a whole album I just rapped one in one take on a song\nImpeccable, you niggas are copies identicals\nIf you suck dick just to get signed no turning back you're bisexual\nYou make me sick no medical I should inject you with poisonous chemicals\nNo you can't borrow my testicles\nAre you dumb? Are you a vegetable?\nAm I a rap god now?\nDo you agree?\nHow long I gotta rap for the respect I need?\nPlaying all damn spots on this god damn team\nTaking game-winning shots from the god damn three\nAm I a rap god now?\nI am whether you like it not\nYo words ain't shit\nDon't talk just rap me out out rap me out my spot\nWho wants it it's all subjective\nRap god is a mindset I selected\nI crowned myself despite rejection\nThen tatted my stomach with living legend\nMy confidence is so effective\nIt makes your hate run turn defective\nI seek no human's weak acceptance\nA wolf doesn't lose no sleep over no sheep\nI workout 7 days that's one week, I can't be weak\nIf I don't eat then no one eats, why? Because I'm the one who feeds\nWhat am I? Adam Sandler? Mr Deeds?\nI don't do favors shuck geez, unless there's Gs involved\nThere's fees involved, e-mail my team it'll get resolved\nBy the way I wrote this I don't do no karaoke when I rap\nI'm hole-in-one you're barely hitting double bogey\nCaught a fade on this shit\nI'm shooting like Kobe I'm Drake on this beat I deserve a fucking trophy\nYou probably didn't notice shout-out Lil Mosey\nEminem my best friend and he doesn't even know me\nI fuck with NF, we'd probably be homies, don't sneeze my blessings aren't actually holy\nI spit no hoagie, more punches than lines of cocaine from a Hollywood bougiefied phony\nI rap no subway, you rap at subway, your fans are used to your boloney\nI'm caking Steve Aoki can't stop me you're not a goalie\nSay you're better then me don't comment at me nigga show me\nYour favorite number's gotta be 69\nWhy? 'Cause if you say you're better you're just trolling\nI strike no bowling\nI cannot swim but because of my diamonds I'm still soaking\nYou're in denial just like a vape that shit's a trick bitch you're still smoking\nPut you niggas in order like alphabetical, you're so hysterical\nCount your blessings like you're numerical\nThat's theoretical, you're sweet, you're diabetical\nI should get rid of you like the garbage man\nI'm taking out the garbage man, you're garbage man, you're not my dawg\nThen why you barking man, can't match my drive, you parking man\nSo get back in the motherfucking garbage can\nMy lungs infested rap game\nI injected rap greats in a syringe I just injected\nI'm infected fucking up my vain connections\nNeed help I'm epileptic\nEast west north south fuck it all directions\nSwitch it, flip it, whip it, it's unexpected\nFuck the beat while I molest the rappers, they just like a necklace I should be fucking arrested\nYou cannot beat me don't try try try try\nHit you like like Backstreet Boys it's bye bye bye bye\nIs that a bird? I am fly fly fly fly fly\nRap against me you might die die die die\nNiggas complaining you just cry cry cry cry\nLook up at God and I said why why why why\nNiggas be running they hide hide hide hide hide hide hide hide hide, hide!\nIf this doesn't prove I'm a Rap god I don't know what will\n10 minute song I'm crazy, I don't got no chill\nI wrote this in 10 minutes, sober, no pills\nI used to rap for fun now rapping pays my bills\nUh!\nI-I-I-I'm the best in the league\nUp next I won't precede\nFucking up everything, won't accept defeat\nFucking up money just like it's Mac and cheese\nStack my cheese\nFeel like a plumber the way I pipe it\nI beat up the pussy just like I fight it\nGo black on the pussy just like a night shift\nI-*gibberish*\nYou might also like[Outro]\nMan cut it cut it cut it bro\nHow long is this shit bro?\nThis went for 10 minutes, geez\nBro you're lying bro, put that on goose bro\nI put that on geese man...\nFuck!15Embed"

The instrumental used at the start of the song is similar to She Cheated Again as well and continues the story of how Dax built his relationship with this girl for two years. The girl described in the song is evidently his first relationship."

How much money you make?\nWho do you know? What do you drive? Where do you stay? (Where do you stay?)\nAnd while you're answerin' those questions, they be calculatin'\nHow much of it they can see themselves try to come in and take\nIf you fragile don't you even try come to this place (Don't come here)\nThey gon' build you just to break you then rebuild you to break\nLet you reach your own limit then heroically save\nAnd that's exactly how Gotham turns you into a slave\n\n[Chorus]\nIn Gotham\nEveryone goes and they lose their souls 'cause they can't control\nIn Gotham\nEveryone lies, it's eye for an eye, you will lose your minds\nIn Gotham\nEveryone goes and they lose their souls 'cause they can't control\nIn Gotham\nLivin' in Gotham, livin' in Gotham\nLivin' in Gotham, livin' in Gotham\n[Verse 3]\nNobody's from here\nBut everybody comes here\nWanting to be famous 'til they realize the price of fame\nBrings close everything that they once feared\nConsumed by the algorithm, it becomes clear\nLife's a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer\nBlind people leading blind people driving cars\nTo a destination that is unclear while they can't steer\nOne year, two years, three years, four\nDrugs, alcohol, addiction, morgue\nFake friends, women gold-diggin' as a sport\nWho convince you, you should live a whole life you can't afford\nNobody sees you, you're continuously ignored\nEverybody wants fame, they don't care what it's for\nThey don't wanna build theirs, they're just tryna take yours\nThis is dog eat dog in this messed up world\n\n[Bridge]\nYou think you need this place but you don't\nHappiness is not a physical place you call home\nDid you ever wonder why you feel like you feel\nWhen you take that time away from your phone\nFake shit goes viral, we know this won't\nThey'll say they care but will never show\nGotham isn't just a place it's a mind state\nWatered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow\n[Chorus]\nIn Gotham\nEveryone goes and they lose their souls 'cause they can't control\nIn Gotham\nEveryone lies, it's eye for an eye, you will lose your minds\nIn Gotham\nEveryone goes and they lose their souls 'cause they can't control\nIn Gotham\nLivin' in Gotham, livin' in Gotham\nLivin' in Gotham, livin' in Gotham\n\n[Outro]\nDon't tell 'em how you feel 'cause I promise they won't call back\nEverybody's in it for money, so it's all bad\nKillin' off my demons, I'm rappin' this in all black\nI ain't gotta, I ain't gotta, I ain't gotta, I ain't gotta\nProve nothin' to Gotham\nThey ain't done nothin' for me\nFor me5Embed"

tandem they walk on a line with the literal and hypothetical\nNiggas is snakes all the weed in the grass got it high on the low like it's off of an edible\nI've been speaking but people don't notice\nI'm Biden my time I might fuck around and change my handle to P.O.T.U.S\nBars united, the state of my mind is as big as Texas so they can't even hold 'em\nYou gotta see what I'm spitting, it's deep\nIf you sink I might save you by pulling a Moses and parting the water inside of your syst\u0435m creating the movem\u0435nt that they call osmosis\nI'm not a lyrical miracle\nGod couldn't give you this skill if you prayed and had sex with bitch named Syllable\nI bet that half of my dick is a quarter an inch over double the African typical\nI got the skill of a veteran mixed with the mind of a serial criminal\nThat's why my numbers are blowing but you think I suck when I spit and these legends pretend I'm invisible\nI'm not even that cynical, I'm barely at my pinnacle\nDon't wanna rap fast but I know it's hypocritical\nYou niggas pitiful if you think you're fucking with me\nIt's blaspheme, my rap skill is better\nAnd my visuals can't be beat, I'm better and I'm original\nDouble the skill of any individual, triple the speed and not even admissible, but very clickable, and non-traditional\nI'm unpredictable and way too fucking analytical\nI got computer parts inside my brain\nI hit up Bill when I rap and he tells me he's coming and then he opens up the gate\nI'm not a monkey but bitch I'm a star and a king like Kong and Bathing Ape\nIf you got a problem with me the equation to solve it is \"Dax equals great\"\nYou don't compute\nYour music's better on mute\nI got the angle on you\nThree-headed monster, my ranking is 90\nYou're barely a 50, your angle's acute\nI got a star-spangled banner with rappers I'm better than, chilling inside of my room\nThey get more shine on a national level but couldn't bear arms that I have moved\nThis isn't confidence, this is practice\nI'm 'bout to flex like lactic acid\nI don't chase money or bitches but somehow they find me like I'm a fucking magnet, magnet, mag-mag-magnet\nI bounce back like elastic\nEvery song I drop's a fucking classic\nI sow seeds that you can't see success was woven in my fabric\nFrom the basement to the attic\nIndependent, my Illmatic flow is sick, I cannot cough 'cause if I do they might just catch it\nWho you know do it better no matter the weather?\nWho you know make it rain and make you get an umbrella?\nI suplex these bars and make them flip then full Nelson Mandela\nI got a Triple Entente and a simile bomb, metaphorically\nTeaching semesters to prove to you people I've mastered the art\nAnd a PhD is what I've got to professor the next generation of rapper whose level will need to be better in order to last in a space where you're barely remembered unless you succumb to the pressure of acting a fool or just sayin' whatever to garner you numbers and sell you some records while puttin' in half of the effort than someone like me who they say isn't shit but is one of the best ever\nWhat they gonna say now\nWhat they gonna say when I'm making moves like a greyhound\nWhat they gonna do when they hanging on like a playground\nSo many bars they can't even motherfucking break down-break down-break down\nAss up bitch, get ya face down, I will never motherfucking lay down\nSay now, Dax is what they motherfucking play now\nMusic for the people that will never get played out\nThis is a breakdown\nI ain't beefin' 'less I'm at a steakhouse\nI move quick like I'm grabbin' some takeout\nAll transactions are done through my PayPal, anyways\nBack to the subject, I'm throwing them up like it's out of the stomach\nI'm fisting the game, got my hand up your ass so it's brown, I feel like I'm controlling a puppet\nI'm at McDonald's in Denver, I told them they should have assumed that I wanted some nuggets\nThey got some fries and a drink for the gang, so I banged on the window and told them to suck it\nI'm out of control\nI got booked for a murder, the beat that I killed is what payed my parole\nI don't use gun bars unless I'm out and I need to reload\nThen I explode and channel my aggression out to a remote location that you cannot reach without a boat and lots of patience\nYou're mistaken if you think I will not wrap you in some bacon and then feed you to a Jewish celebration that I'm at because of someone I was dating\nDo not play at my station, the X in the box that I chose was for Caucasian\nI would of chose black but then there's half the chance I would of got the job I need to make payments\nI'm not playing P.S.5 of the last chicks I fucked were Asian\nI'm not China do it but Taiwan to say that I'm not hatin'\nFuck I'm amazing I should play for Portland I'm trailblazin'\nI had a dream I rapped naked then cock slapped Satan\nI dread rap like I'm Jamaican\nSak passe to all my Haitians\nI don't jerk my chicken often, I rice peas and get creative\nI'm not overrated, I'm overhated\nPeople call me corny 'cause I'm c-c-c-c-creative\nYou're the opposite of what you do when you're constipated\nThen try to tell the people that I'm not in the conversation\nFuck all the awards and all the stupid nominations\nI've about the show the definition of domination\nI'm about to fuck it with the deadliest combination of rap sing, mad ting, fast ting\nAin't nobody fuckin' with me when I get to rappin'\nI am the definition of a nigga who's smashin', everlastin', gaspin', actin', adaptin'\nThis beat is like a tank that I'm gassin'\nThey will never get the concepts I'm graspin'\nSo they make jokes and start laughin'\nAnd trashin', bashin' and chantin'\nWhile I'm constantly surpassin' levels that I used to be on way back when\nI felt like I was John Paxson back in MJ's show Last Dance when splashin' that shot fucking happened\nI'm not human my constant improvements about to start a revolution\nI X-Men out of the equation like a mutant\nIf there's better, put our lyrics side by side and fuckin' prove it\nShoutout Eminem the way they treat me, I just might lose it HAHAHAHAHA\nI'm not superstitious, I'm spiritual, I'm not religious\nI pray to God every time that I murder a beat on my knees and I ask him for forgiveness\nI'm 'bout to Bale on you niggas like Christian, then Catholic all of you into submission then go to the church that I grew up in and talk to the deacon and ask why he touched all those children\nYou people see it but you don't have vision\nI'm not a piece you can put in position\nI don't play chess and I check'd-mate you hear, but you do not listen\nSo many lines I'm about to go fishin'\nI'm cookin' it up like it's out of the kitchen\nThey call me a pussy I think that it's funny because I just bought me a couple of kittens\nThey cannot compete, there is no competition\nI stay in the cut like a couple of stitches\nI'm runnin' a train on these beats like these rappers in Hollywood due to these video Vixens\nI'm not stoppin', I'ma do it often\nWon't fall or leaf like the trees in autumn\nI'm winter cold so I got them coughing\nThey'll scream my name like they're at an auction\nDon't Jack my flow or I'll get it poppin'\nThen brush it off and get back to flossin'\nMy drip is real I don't gotta faucet\nI'm Michael Scott how I'm in the office, I'll make you nauseous\nThis is not Tik-Tok rap, I don't got time for that\nI'm ahead that's why they talk behind my back\nThat went over yours and right up your ass\nOnly person I can throw them at is No Life Shaq\nI kill it, so much drip, I got spillage\nSo many bars I could feed a village\nI pop their eyes, I'm one of a kind\nThey can tell I eat my spinach\nI'm settin' a record will somebody pretty please call Guiness?\nI see red when I'm in my zone like it's fourth and inches\nDon't blink you just might miss it\nI am the best in this business\nGet another person to do what I've done without no recognition\nThat's no playlists or assistance from a major label system\nAnd the radio and zero time on any television\nGo drink OJ and watch Simpsons, I bet you won't find a witness\nWhat I got to do to get it through to you? I'm motherfucking Dax and I'm motherfucking immovable\nIf anybody's better, then put us inside a cubicle and let us rap it out and I promise I'll make it beautiful\nThis shit is in my veins so I'm taking these pharmaceuticals\nThey need to lock me up 'cause I'm barrin' up like a juvenile\nI'm about to get it poppin', I'm never stoppin', you better proceed with caution\nI'm rappin' and paying homage and lyrically giving knowledge\nI'm brutally fuckin' honest and everybody know that I spit fiery flames\nI'm saying As-salamu alaykum to my Akhis in the Middle of the East And my Habibis in the Himalayas\nBetter respect it when you motherfucking speak on my name\nI'm ready to burn down everything that tries to get in my way\nI'm ready to turn up on the industry and fuck up the game\nI'm fucking insane\nAnd my name's Dax and I'm a God so don't use it in vain\nYou might also like[Outro]\nI used to be a janitor3Embed"
