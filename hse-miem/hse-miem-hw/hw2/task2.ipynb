symphonies i make mozart than most my key lyrically is noted on a scale above the whole industry its dax i got bars out in georgia twentyminute songsll probably illinois ya i got ptsd from the killins of these beats im a veteran i came in the game like a soldier i could sun you like barbosa me and nash playin soccer out in canada thats trudeau i aint never lied in my prime how i minister the flow is unknown they dont know where its comin from like phone calls with star 69 they say i say nothin that im corny and outdated if i rapped in the 90s id probably be famous that the flow and the cadence is abrasive i be blackin out on beats even niggas started callin me a racist like aunt jemima i need an oscar they admire my wiener they blowin me like hurricane katrina i get superdome defenses tryna find a way to stop me im offensive with the wordplay i minored misdemeanors bitch you might need a subpoena to see me like john cena high jab ya huh then wrap you like a turban pack a stan in a can and ship him to eminem and say dax needs a feature and pray that its not a burden why because i rap in cursive they treat my lyrics like the bible the og and the king james version this colloquial my

of genres i aint pop or urban im my own category you can call that shit purpose listen i need to get this off my chest you a bitch if im rappin and you say you not impressed your input does not add money to my check who the fuck about to do this and not even break a sweat man they committin genocide tryna exterminate the lyricist while saying dax is the antithesis thats means opposite but if im the opposite then how am i independent and the games still profitin its not supposed to happen they cappin im a goddamn savage when rappin gas mask yo casket cause the smoke i spit will give you lung

against the machine ima need a team im two and a half men myself like charlie sheen this industrys sick dax is the vaccine top five in this bitch at least the past three if they say otherwise they antivaccine and the mandate passed suppresses they free speech cause im in a different category my whole life is a allegory the truth i speak is a doubleedge and thats why theres no matrimony everybody knows what i came to do so they separate and the alimony is why im broke but i dont care because my impact is mandatory in a age of fake and im perplexed by the hate why flex in your songs if they carry no weight if my shits trash but spreads at this rate then maybe its you who has no taste and i dont normally pray but today ill say dear god please wash these lames away and ironically thats the name of my song thats gold with no fuckin radio play now its back to the topic let me hit you wit a switch how the fuck im pussy if you always on my dick i dont rap about the typical my money or a bitch and if i ever do flex im in the gym doin lifts i dont pack nothin but six my abs stay ripped im like an ad lib bitch i stay in the mix every time i see a beat in my scope its a hit

shit like a potty mouth nigga with a stank upper lip and this wasnt planned im spittin facts from a realworld scan they cable im streamin they nice but the difference they cant do it on demand im the man bbbombin on these beats if you tally up the bands got enough ammunition to supply the taliban every bar is like a bullet they go doodoo people try to dodge but they cant like a fuckin caravan okay now im warmed up i can feel the sweat the bars drip and turn complex hit the floor as i gas the beat then evaporate and condense in a generation where common sense is not common sense we need a real rapper but when you say nas they think you mean lil nas x and thats not a diss i dont want to get canceled youtube dont take my channel dont copyright cause if you do ill strike and beat at you im

they say a cplus if you think im a 50 then you got no sense like the famous rap song that is called in da club calm down let me bust a rhyme and kick flips while im on my grind i got tricks up my sleeve i could make a simile disappear like the line inside this line and every time i rhyme they see an optimus in his prime i transform i could reach the blind my minds design is one of a kind youll find there is no one like i and that is i why i must keep it goin constant motion locomotive i lack promotion i provoke em break down every system but still be growin so sick that they might need some

skill skill skill  never mind you wont find no one like me i wish   that you would see me for what i am instead of ignorant top comments you see on the gram im a onceinalifetime type of man who actually cares bout the content and all the fans i guess it doesnt matter they piss poor weak bladder i gotta keep them at bay like the packers dont stare cause youll need a ladder they pass words around like computer hackers im built different i was never breastfed when i was two years old i was dropped on my head in school like dej loaf theyd try me but just like the second part of her name i was all about the bread so i stayed focused i couldnt afford to fumble wrestlin demons in my bed like the royal rumble paid dues they aint never gave me a bundle but they discount people who would fuckin mumble this life is not fair they dread dax like jamaican hair because they know they cant compare then stock my work and resell it on the market and give dax no shares what the fuck im bout to slide like a hockey puck duck like donald shoot like lebron and tax niggas like obama do the stanky leg and heat it up like a sauna while you talk to yo god and have to deal with yo karma assalamu alaykum i come in peace i love all religions and practice what i preach if you came into this world and you bleed youre like me cause love is my religion and i love what i see im not a christian rapper i just rap about faith without takin the bible and throwin it in your face and ironically when you do it that way more people end up saved i paved my way by scrapin it you aint never seen a nigga like me if you did i guarantee they was on some label shit they want me to leaf im not rakin it twenty minutes bitch this my statement halfway and im just warmin up now im bout to freak this

rather jack off inside my home i can already see the fake they rise quick then fall like easy bake then resurrect like christ on easter day they straight ass i aint talkin about a piece of cake uh im turnin up the concentration free in this bitch but im not a mason came in the game and the beats im blazin bring heat thatll torch and destroy the matrix line after line got em snortin greatness raw spelt backwards is what im wagin dax is the brand and the occupation occupies the real so the constant hatin comes from the fake who deny the basic that dax is a part of the conversation with no cosign or major playlists radio play or talent agent anger and rage cause they cant contain it straight to top and the spot is vacant those who oppose go straight to hell hah and go twerk with satan im spittin it mad fast i aint gonna backtrack my flows in a hazmat im fixin to blow game in a backpack they spittin the rap cap they know what they doin and they tryna be clones im ice cold no steve stone unless youre in austin texas wwe you niggas restless you are not getting in youre not on my guest list dont fit like tetris im bout to make this flip anybody hatin can come and suck my dick everything i spit is like glue it sticks when you poops the only time youre the shit everybody wanna just get rich youre all my sons just like chris im appalled cause you always miss and if you hit you still cant do it like this and if you did your brain would explode im next to blow im a whole series youre just an episode gimme legume heh like a vegetable beatin me is a stretch you better get flexible killin this beat but the crime is sensible firstdegree i murder thee then mastermind then phd my schemes are credible so the rhymes may not be detectable over heads they go and fall on deaf ears the buzz i mades beyond lightyears so when theyre toxic like britney spears i barely hear cause i just switch gears you aint never seen a rapper strike this much fear amongst his foes and his socalled peers so like visine drops let me make this clear im dax and i been in a different tier and its fire fire call for help my desire burns and they passion melts independent so i might not be felt but i sign my checks thats a higher self dont pull my card cause you might get dealt my hand of gods from the bible belt my waves so big even michael phelps cant swim my shit without some help so breathe huhhuh huhhuh you might need a second to catch up dax is on a tear and theyre lookin for backup semiautomatic and i hit like a mack truck breathe huhhuh huhhuh and i dont give a flying fat fuck yes i am a sinner and i drink and do cuss but like dj khaled i got the keys to unlock the beast extend my reach from down beneath and knock off those who cannot compete but want to act like they can fuck with me its okkk like racial tension dax nice lets avoid him and never mention hell elevate to a new dimension and leave us here in the kiddy section sixtyfive metaphors wheres my pension i retire beats and they go to heaven appraise them not like a reverend i mean raise their value im still here like a statue starin at you i will stand the test of time and if i sit ill still be twice as tall with my head in the sky lookin down at all you birds who talk on twitter thinkin theres power behind your words callin me corny behind your computer in the fuckin suburbs hahahaha hahahahaha haha youre way too late heh ive mastered this and now im better than great heh heh uh in fact i might just be top five alltime or at least top ten well maybe nine minus five divided by two minus the amount times we all get to live this life thats one dont waste it youd be way more successful with dax on your playlist cause i rap about motivation which you lack cause if you focused on yourself you wouldnt have time to go online spend your time there heh just to shit on dax oh its sad you know ive never had someone more successful tell me im wack and oh i forgot im black so im supposed to rap about guns bitches clothes and tons of cash while you pricks pray i lose my shit while you sit at home and clap and thats the kicker heh you dont even get paid to hate heh heh on twitter heh it just makes you bitter and my skin gets thicker and it actually promotes my work indirectly and over a period of time you sheep herd and all just make me richer i got you in a bind like a boa constrictor im on the way up like a zipper and only fade in the cut with a pair of clippers but im no clown my shits real and thats why despite how you feel it all still spreads around up and down with resoundin sound even haters got to admit that dax got that bounce boy you better run home when you see me i dont mean a baseball mound im the king in this bitch thats why i let my hair grow in the shape of a crown you better bow down then get up i wont let up or let go i take the hate they throw and embody it for the energy to go turn up at my soldout shows across the globe south africa nigeria zambia liberia canada i need expedia and oh i got a message for the media i dont care if that fake shit feedin ya you a sellout if you glorify that trash that does not meet the criteria im a patriot ive united states every bill i check got buccs and nears tom bradys throw completion rate thats a bar if you dont get it but if you did i have to explain for those who still give me no credit  well well well actually ive got my i got my own money ive always been a big advocate for debit   i dont obsess over whats not mine i already think im great they whine about dax like a large amount of grapes then act pregnant like they made me and i popped out way too late and they never ever recovered from postpartum baby weight thats not my fault i did my job and made waves like rod i put my heart on ice and if you slip and fall i hope you break your jaw so you cant talk at all and have to cry oh im gettin off track or maybe i should just go and finish that like no life shaq you want to know what pisses me off the most people wanna pretend that they can do what i do drop these tracks backtoback with impeccable raps stay humble move how i move hit it on the nail youre a loose screw aint nobody fuckin with me in this booth its a blatant lie if they try to say im not the truth inspirational all relatable undebatably one of a kind intrinsic fire lit inside to match my grind critical thinkin

to earth to rid you of these retards man i hope they dont cancel me for that cancel culture is a bitch you can say anything you want as long youre not rich but if youre poor oh they might get you too because if you ever become successful theyll use your past against you we cant even be human we cant even make mistakes everyones a dick but wont come say it to your face we spend our lives looking left and right while we run our race then wonder why were depressed and always finish shit in second place get up and get gone you aint right if youre doin nothin wrong get off of that phone find out korea like kim jongun find your passion and cash in like kim kardashian and bask in the fact that it takes action to be a massive attraction and stay active instead of bein passive reach out and go grab it and make habits fuck status youll stay static just march no madness this bracket is an elite synapsis all info passed has been imagined no draggin if you wanna get cash then start smashin instead of waitin til youre in a casket and braggin on what happened in the past of your life as the basic average be a savage attack it rip it slash it cremate it take its ashes and smoke it gas it so hard that the pedal smashes stop livin in captions youre better than that you have it addict like gogo gadget youre equipped to wreak havoc emphatic im bout to weaponize a generation this road im blazin got my enemies wishin they had never tried to  crack the pavement poetic justice everybodys here in my arraignment murder to goliath and i am fuckin david you couldnt save em with the flash

the dax impact and you wont for a while but once you get old and this life gets real youll wanna go back and wish my words touched you like a pedophile you must be crazy if you think ima stop i was hip without hiphop between the lines i could read the signs they dont want music they want songs thatll get a whole generation locked so i stay back and push my little positive message isolated from the game up in the nosebleed section no awards or recognition but my state of correction facilitates the people chained to get a bit up in heaven and thats a felony even amnesia couldnt make them not remember me the word meme is short for memories so when you tryna break what ive made keep in mind you helpin me build a legacy and thats why im right in they face somethin they cannot erase take copy and paste penning these verses and eight the penmanship i exude is of dystopian taste characterized by world issues full of drama and pain me picasso and da vinci are of similar grain the reality i paint is vivid wicked ingrained into the skull of every human who allows me to take them on a trip where the pictures arent perfectly framed crooked cracked and maimed full of anger and rage spat on with graffiti lit in fiery flames from the mind of a human who is fuckin deranged and goin down in history as one of the greats and thats a fact and to think this all came from an epiphany overnight janitor to poet to songs to moments and now finally symphonies its dax   fuckin up everybody who put me in a category thinkin i was never gonna make it if we talkin bout the lyrics or the cadence or the meanin of the songs theres not another approachin what ive been makin ive been sittin waitin innovatin im patient im waitin to bust deliberatin on what i should come and beat in the cut people say
